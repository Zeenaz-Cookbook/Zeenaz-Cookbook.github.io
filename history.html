            <p class="mb-3">
                Dolly first learned the basics of cooking from her father in Tanzania at a very young age and continued to pick up 
                new skills simply by watching others. She was blessed with a natural sense of creativity and trained as a seamstress 
                and designer. While going on to teach those crafts in Dar-es-Salaam, her passion for experimenting with different 
                flavours in the kitchen was never far behind. 
                <br><br>
                In 1962, she married Sadru Pisani and thirteen years later they immigrated to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. 
                They opened Zeenaz in 1985, fulfilling their dream of bringing Vancouver its first taste of East African-style Indian cuisine. 
                It was truly a family affair: Sadru's entrepreneurial spirit, Dolly's incredible cooking talent and even the restaurant's 
                name which fuses those of their children and grandchildren. Dolly's inventiveness with traditional dishes and unique flavours 
                along with Sadru's famous hospitality resulted in a loyal following, not to mention rave reviews from local food critics, 
                Tourism Vancouver, and the Lonely Planet. 
                <br><br>
                In 2003, Dolly and Sadru opened Zeenaz Kitchen to meet the growing demand for their snack foods, pickles, and catering 
                services. The secret recipe for their signature snack product Chevdo, a blend of puffed rice, nuts and savour and sweet spices, 
                has been refined to perfection over the years. It really must be tasted! Zeenaz products are now distributed across North America 
                and Dolly and Sadru maintain their tradition of serving fresh, home-cooked products that are made with love and pride.
