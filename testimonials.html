                                            "Masala Prawns"...I made this as a starter dish for my friends. The recipe was easy 
                                            to follow and the final product was amazing. My friends were literally licking their fingers...and 
                                            the dish turned out amazing! My friends keep on asking me when I am going to make this 
                                            dish again for them.The cook book is accurate and very precise. A lot of hard work has gone in to this book. 
                                            I highly recommend this cook book to all food lovers! This book is in a class of its own! Don't miss out 
                                            it’s the best $$ I have spent on a cook book!

                                            The marinade is what I think made it such a big hit!  I use the recipes from it all the time now.

                                        Thank you for the meal. 
                                        The food was excellent, but it was your friendliness that I truly loved. 
                                        I felt like I was a guest in your home, not just another hungry person to empty your trays and fill your cash register.
